# Unofficial-Roguelands-Patch
The Unofficial Roguelands Patch fixes many of Rogueland's bugs.
The following bugs are fixed (In no particular order):
 - the Halo augment doesn't work after opening a chest or buying an item.
 - Alchemy station recipes show old Droid Fuel instead of Nuldmg Potion.
 - If you get through a world very fast, random events carry over into the next world.
 - Quitting while frosted causes a semi-permanent slowdown effect.
 - "QUIT WITHOUT SAVING" still saves anyway. (Note: Still saves, but the message on the button has been changed to be accurate.)
 - Shift-clicking a droid out of an equip slot causes you to semi-permanently lose stats.
 - When trashing large stacks of items, or multiple wealth trophies at once, the resultant stack of credits can be higher than 9999.
 - A few of the shop stands on the station say "Insufficient Scrap Metal" when they actually cost credits or wealth trophies.
 - If enough EXP is gained to level up multiple times instantaneously, sometimes not all of the gained levels will award skill increases.
 - The LightSworn crystal does a needlessly high amount of damage, instantly unlocking the Echo uniform upon use.
 - The Rogue Bandana still requires you to have stamina to jump and dash, despite causing them to not use stamina.
 - A few different Stat-Related Fixes and Corrections:
	- The HELPR 55 bot and its ultimate forms say they boost DEX, but actually boost TEC. (Note: Now actually boosts DEX. There are plenty of bots that boost TEC already.)
	- The Eye Gadget now properly grants DEX, like it says, instead of TEC on level-up.
	- The Oculus Goggles now grant TEC on level up, like they say they should.
Other features that aren't exactly bugfixes (In no particular order):
 - Shift-clicking into the storage now intelligently merges stacks.
